Assessing the Impact of Social Determinants on Obesity Rates Across U.S. Counties
This repository contains the code and analysis for the project titled "Assessing the Impact of Social Determinants on Obesity Rates Across U.S. Counties: A Machine Learning Analysis and Policy Recommendations".

Project Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict county-level obesity rates in the U.S. based on various social determinants of health, such as economic factors, access to healthcare, food environment, and neighborhood characteristics. The aim is to provide insights into how community-level factors influence obesity and to guide policymakers in developing targeted, data-driven public health strategies.

Key Features
Data Source: The project leverages data from the CDC's Diabetes Surveillance System.
Prediction Target: Obesity rate (percentage) for U.S. counties in 2021.
Machine Learning Models: Various models such as Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were evaluated for their predictive power.
Performance Metrics: Models were compared using R-squared, MSE, MAE, and RMSE to assess prediction accuracy.
Contents
Code/: Contains the Python scripts for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building.
Report.pdf: Detailed report explaining the methodology, results, and policy recommendations based on the analysis.
